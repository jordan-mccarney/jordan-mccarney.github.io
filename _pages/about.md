<br>
My name is Jordan McCarney and I am a final year PhD student in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/) at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) under the supervision of [Dr. David Henry](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/people/davidhenry/). <br> 
<br>
My research interests concern the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, and in particular, the Euler equations for geophysical fluid dynamics in both the ocean and atmosphere.<br>
